### Research
I am a PhD student at The University of Adelaide under the supervision of Nigel
Bean and Peter Taylor. We are looking at numerical approximations for
stochastic fluid models so that we can compute probabilities for stochastic
fluid-fluid models.

My interest are broad -- applied probability and stochastic modelling,
optimisation and operation research, statistics and modelling.

My Master's looked at developing new statistical inference algorithms and
methodologies for models of wholesale electricity prices.


### Brief Bio
I hold a B. Math. Comp. Sci., B. Fin. and an M. Phil. all from the University of
Adelaide.

Crows fan and Cricket tragic.
