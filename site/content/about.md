### Research
I am a PhD student at The University of Adelaide under the supervision of [Nigel Bean](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=z3fjC8sAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Peter Taylor](https://acems.org.au/our-people/peter-taylor). We are looking at numerical approximations for stochastic fluid models so that we can compute probabilities for stochastic fluid-fluid models.

My interest are broad -- applied probability and stochastic modelling, optimisation and operation research, statistics and modelling.

My Master's looked at developing new statistical inference algorithms and methodologies for models of wholesale electricity prices. My supervisors were [Giang Nguyen](https://www.giangthunguyen.com/) and [Nigel Bean](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=z3fjC8sAAAAJ&hl=en).


### Brief Bio
